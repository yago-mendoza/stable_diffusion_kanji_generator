# Recommendations for Stable Diffusion Kanji Generator

## Model Architecture

- Consider using a UNet-based architecture for the image generation component.
- Experiment with different text encoders for processing English definitions.

## Training Process

- Start with a smaller dataset and gradually increase its size to ensure the training pipeline works correctly.
- Use mixed precision training to reduce memory usage and speed up training.
- Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Data Augmentation

- Apply random rotations, flips, and slight distortions to the kanji images during training.
- Use text augmentation techniques for the English definitions to improve robustness.

## Evaluation

- Develop a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of generated kanji images.
- Consider using human evaluation for a subset of generated images.

## Future Improvements

- Explore multi-task learning by incorporating stroke order prediction.
- Investigate the use of attention mechanisms to focus on specific parts of the kanji during generation.
- Consider implementing a web interface for easy interaction with the trained model.
